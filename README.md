# Toy Crypto

One file here is intended as a pedagogical tool. Motivated students from a humanities background (e.g. attorneys) will be able to understand how many blockchain applications simply fall out of the technical structure.

The technical structure of a hash tree encasing each previous block in an ever-deepening layer of amber can be understood if they understand hashing.

They don't need to understand actual SHA256, an intuition is sufficient.

The RSA implementation also imparts some intuition.
